# Visualization Linting

![As-Is](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-As--Is-e8762c.svg)

Code for experimenting with different ways of surfacing stylistic, analytic, or visual discrepancies in visualizations. This code is part of an academic project undertaken by [Tableau Research](http://research.tableau.com) as part of an academic paper, ["Surfacing Visualization Mirages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02316)."

More details are available in the paper, but the core of the project is that a user can create a [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JSON specification of a chart, along with the backing data, and we will perform a series of "[lints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))" to test the robustness, fragility, or simple design of the chart. The results of these tests are listed underneath the chart. A test result in red represents a failure, and suggests that the analyst might have a data quality or chart design error worth investigating.

Note that this is a proof of concept testing platform for research. This application is meant to be a demo of potential functionality and has not been designed to scale to internet contexts. Future work will involve developing strategies and algorithms for improving the performance of this type of system.

# Why Visualization Linting?

 Many of these tests rely on a concept called "[metamorphic testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_testing)," where we make changes to the underlying data and check to see how much the resulting chart changes. For instance, if we [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) the data underlying a chart, we would not expect huge variability in the resulting chart. A failure in this case (a large visual change after bootstrapping, or large inconsistencies after bootstrapping many times) would suggest small sample size, outliers, high variability, or any of a number of issues that might cast doubt on any insights derived from the chart.

# Run the Linter

1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
2. Install dependences by running:

```
yarn
```

3. Run lint and image-gen server

```
yarn serve
```

4. Run browser based demo

```
yarn start
```

This should open up a browser window showing a list of Vega-Lite specs. Select an existing Vega-Lite spec from our list of demos, or write your own. Linting a spec in the browser demo may take upwards of a minute.

Note that we support only a small subset of Vega-Lite specs, and that many features of Vega-Lite such as layering, concatenation, and maps are not linted. "SPEC NOT SUPPORTED" will appear in these cases.
